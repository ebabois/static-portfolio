                <p>
                  How a shift in focus for the platform's sales model turns out to set a big change in motion for the themes.
                </p>

              <p class="chapter">Introduction</p>
              <h2>My Role</h2>
              <p>
                From 2016-2019 I was responsible for the platform's Video On Demand themes. This responsibility included design, maintenance and development efforts of existing and new themes.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this time I lead the UI/UX efforts to improve the usability of the themes on the platform. Together with the Customer Success team we uncovered user needs and found solutions. And, together with Marketing we strategized to create high converting themes.
              </p>

              <p class="chapter">The Challenge</p>
              <h2>...ready, ...set, ...HOLD ON?!</h2>
              <p>
                The initial assignment was simple; creating new, attractive and easy to personalize themes. Because the current themes on the platform looked dated and proved to be too hard to personalize.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it also became clear that the current themes were too expensive. High in development time and cumbersome maintenance, and had little commonality between them.
              </p>
              <h2 class="serif-font">
                "themes were too expensive, both in development time and in
                maintenance time, with very little commonality between them"
              </h2>
            </section>


            <section class="text-section">
              <p class="chapter">The Approach</p>
              <h2>First things, first.</h2>
              <p>
                So, before starting any design work we had to find ways to reduce this development cost. By looking at some of our indirect competitors we looked for other ways to structure the themes. This helped us gain insight to the industry's standards and practices as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a page and asset normalization approach we would reduce the cost of the themes. This structure allows more frequent new theme releases and easy switching between themes.
              </p>

              <!-- visualize this -->
              <p>But how do we get there?</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Stabilize</strong>: Find and fix crucial bugs in legacy themes</li>
                <li><strong>Research</strong>: Establish master user flow and structure design</li>
                <li><strong>Development</strong>: Develop new master themes with price model variations</li>
                <li><strong>Retire</strong>: Move existing clients off of legacy themes. </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Predictable and Familiar</h3>
              <p>
                An important addition to this is the master user flow. This user flow uses heuristics as a guide to a pleasant and predictable user experience. Because happy subscribers equal happy clients.

              <h3>Flexible</h3>
              <p>
                No two clients are alike. Therefor the user flow works with a variety of pricing, product and delivery type options. During the research process we identified these variations and the expected theme behavior.

            <h2>Introducing the Powerful Intelivideo VOD master themes</h2>
            <p>
              Flexible enough to be the delivery page, powerful enough to be a stand-alone website. Built to create a deep sense of loyalty with their subscribers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clients will love how easy it is to build successful businesses on the themes. The ease of use for their subscribers will allow it to play an important part of their daily life.
            </p>

            <h3>Designed to Convert</h3>
            <p>
              Themes with a clear focus to connect with the different type of audiences, hot, warm and cold. Sections crafted with the purpose to educate the audience on their story and mission. Reiterating brand credibility with logo endorsements, reviews and intro videos.
            </p>
            <p>
              And, retention focused by adhering to best practices, predictable user experience and transparency.

            <h3>Audited and Maintained</h3>
            <p>
              To find remaining user issues, we perform user tests and watch support tickets. Together with Customer Success we find solution to address these issues. Improvements released on an iterative basis.

              We are currently looking into putting A/B testing and heatmap tracking in place.

            <h3>If this, than this, if that, than that. Also known as formulas</h3>
            <p>
              There are different ways clients can sell their content on the themes, such offering content for sale, rent, and subscription.
              Then, they can specify how they want to handle pre-sale access. The variations have been established in
              the Master User Flow on what behavior will be triggered based on the pricing and delivery preferences specified by the client.
            </p>

            <p>Pricing Models</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Transactional (tVOD): Rent, one-time purchase.</li>
              <li>Subscription (sVOD): Subscribe on a monthly or yearly basis.</li>
              <li>Both (tVOD + sVOD): Rent, one-time purchase or subscribe on a monthly or yearly basis</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Content Delivery Models</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Default: Users can browse the library before purchase.</li>
              <li>Log In Required: Users can not see any library contents before purchase.</li>
              <li>Members: Theme handles the delivery of the content only, users are required to log in.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With the new structure in place we can now focus on developing effective themes, focused on conversion and reducing churn in subscribers.

            <h2>Testing Performance</h2>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>
              During a User Task design meeting with the CTO, COO and a Customer Success Manager we brainstormed on the tasks a user would try to complete
              on the themes or what support tickets have been coming in specifically.
            </p>

            <p>During the User Tests we want to know:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Can a user complete the tasks given?</li>
              <li>How does it perform compared to a similar platform?</li>
              <li>What is a user expecting to find?</li>
              <li>Does the user feel confident using the platform?</li>
            </ul>

              <h2>The Preliminary Results are In</h2>
              <h3>Conversions</h3>
              <p>
                The newer VOLT theme is a theme that converts much higher than all the other themes at 3.5%. The older Summit theme converts at a mere 1.8%. According to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization/#what-is-a-good-ecommerce-conversion-rate" target="_blank">BigCommerce</a>, average e-commerce conversion rates are about 1% – 2%. So any 2%+ conversion rate is a great result for themes.
              </p>
              <p>
                But, the conversion numbers are very client dependent.  The conversion numbers are more favorable when:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>There's a strategic marketing plan in place</li>
                <li>The price point is good for the content offered  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In conclusion we can say that we may be able to increase conversion numbers a bit on a theme with the help of A/B testing. But in reality, it is the client who has to do the heavy lifting with strategic marketing and pricing.

              <h3>Low Maintenance</h3>
              <p>
                With a normalized theme structure the maintenance is much easier. The consistent asset requirements allow for easy switching between themes. And, adding new feature releases on a selective basis is easy, even post-launch. Development of new themes is down by as much as 75% in development time.
