                <h1>SVOD Theme Development</h1>
                <p>
                  With the shift in focus from transactional sales to a subscription based sales model,
                  a big change was set in place for the themes on the Denver based VOD platform.
                </p>
              </div>
            </section>

            <section class="text-section">
              <p class="chapter">Introduction</p>
              <h2>My Role</h2>
              <p>
                In 2016 I was asked to move from my marketing focused position and take on the sole responsibility of the platform's themes,
                as the new Creative Developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this role I am responsible for the design, maintenance and the development of themes.
                I also lead the UI/UX efforts to continually improve the customer's experience and I work close with stakeholders to
                identify user needs.
              </p>

              <p class="chapter">The Challenge</p>
              <h2>...ready, ...set, ...HOLD ON?!</h2>
              <p>
                Though the initial assignment was simple &mdash; add more attractive themes on the platform &mdash;
                it quickly became clear that currently the themes were too expensive, both in development time and in
                maintenance time, with very little commonality between them.
              </p>

            <section class="text-section">
              <p class="chapter">The Approach</p>
              <h2>First things, first.</h2>
              <p>
                During competitor research we looked at some of the big players in the website and e-commerce theme space,
                to get a feel for the industry standard for theme structure and development.
                By normalizing the structure of the themes and their assets into a master theme structure (similar to
                the parent/child theme concept in the website theme space), both the development and the maintenance of these new
                themes would be reduced dramatically.
              </p>

              <!-- visualize this -->
              <p>But how do we get there?</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Stabilize</strong>: Find and fix crucial bugs in legacy themes.</li>
                <li><strong>Research</strong>: Establish master theme and design</li>
                <li><strong>Development</strong>: Develop new master themes with model variations</li>
                <li><strong>Retire</strong>: Move existing clients off legacy themes.</li>
              </ul>

                By normalizing the pages that are involved with finding, purchasing, consuming content and account management the Master User Flow is established.
                This user flow aims to honor the principles of Nielsen’s Heuristics to ensure a pleasant, predictable experience for the user.

                The tasks users generally want to accomplish are organized in four main categories:

                <li>Finding Content / Information</li>

                This Master User Flow also needs to be able to respond to the different variations possible depending on pricing type,
                product type and delivery type. These variations have been documented in the Master User Flow research process and the expected theme
                behavior based on these preferences specified by the client.

            <p>
              There are different ways clients can sell their content on the themes, such offering content for sale, rent, and subscription.
              Then, they can specify how they want to handle pre-sale access. The variations have been established in
              the Master User Flow on what behavior will be triggered based on the pricing and delivery preferences specified by the client.
            </p>

            <p>Pricing Models</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Transactional (tVOD): Rent, one-time purchase.</li>
              <li>Subscription (sVOD): Subscribe on a monthly or yearly basis.</li>
              <li>Both (tVOD + sVOD): Rent, one-time purchase or subscribe on a monthly or yearly basis</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Content Delivery Models</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Default: Users can browse the library before purchase.</li>
              <li>Log In Required: Users can not see any library contents before purchase.</li>
              <li>Members: Theme handles the delivery of the content only, users are required to log in.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With the new structure in place we can now focus on developing effective themes, focused on conversion and reducing churn in subscribers.

            <h2>Testing Performance</h2>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>
              During a User Task design meeting with the CTO, COO and a Customer Success Manager we brainstormed on the tasks a user would try to complete
              on the themes or what support tickets have been coming in specifically.
            </p>

            <p>During the User Tests we want to know:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Can a user complete the tasks given?</li>
              <li>How does it perform compared to a similar platform?</li>
              <li>What is a user expecting to find?</li>
              <li>Does the user feel confident using the platform?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="serif-font">
              "How does our platform perform compared to a similar platform?"
            </h2>
            -->
            <h2>Testing Performance</h2>
            <h3>Conversions</h3>
            <p>
              While some themes are converting much higher than the 2.3% benchmark, we are putting an effort in place to improve these conversion rates.
            </p>
            <p>
              So far we have found that these numbers are highly influenced by the following factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What theme is it?</li>
              <li>What client is it?</li>
              <li>How good is their (external) marketing effort?</li>
              <li>How good is their price point?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This insight does not only allow us to finetune the themes for better conversion numbers, it also allows us to set our clients up for success by sharing this data with them.
            </p>
            <!--
            <h3>What's in a button?</h3>
            <p>
              This is arguably the most debated issue for the themes, what does the button say and where should it go? With different pricing and
              delivery content models there are a few scenarios possible.

              if one price
              if one price and one Subscription
              if no price and one subscription,
              if multiple prices

              <p>
                Attractive themes that are flexible enough to be a delivery website and powerful enough to be the client’s primary website, strategically
                built to create a deep sense of loyalty with their subscribers. Clients will love how easy it is to build successful businesses on the platform,
                their customers will love using their websites allowing it to play an important part of their daily life.
              </p>

              <p>
                With the stable master theme in place, maintenance is much easier, asset requirements between themes are consistent and functionaility
                is easily added, even retro-actively. Development of new themes is down by as much as 75% in development time.

              We do not have ultimate control over the entire experience of the user - as it is up the client to complete this to full
              circle by adding high quality content and a strategic marketing plan - but we will strive to do our part to set up our
              client for success by focusing on the user and educating the clients on best practices.
            </p>
